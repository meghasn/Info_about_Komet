## Project Description
The goal of this project was to develop an automatic aircraft engine ON/OFF time detection system through a mobile device. The application would begin recording audio as soon as the pilot selected the departure and destination locations. The main challenge was to accurately predict the engine start time while filtering out irrelevant audio from the surroundings. Additionally, environmental factors, such as wind, and variations in engine parameters due to different weather conditions needed to be considered for accurate predictions.

The data collection process initially relied on scraping suitable aircraft startup samples from open sources like YouTube. Later, data was obtained directly from pilots to improve data quality. The final model was designed using a simple yet efficient Artificial Neural Network (ANN) that processed raw audio into MFCC features. This approach facilitated fast and memory-efficient deployment on mobile devices, enabling accurate predictions with minimal processing time.

## Komet Fleet Management App
As part of this project, I contributed significantly to the development of the Komet Fleet Management App, tailored to meet specific aviation fleet management requirements. The app included the following key features:

- Login Page: To enable user to create an account to log into the app
  
- Flight Page: Pilots could select flight details, such as arrival and destination locations, to initiate audio data collection from the flight.

- Timestamp Page: The application accurately predicted the status of the flight engine (ON/OFF) by monitoring the audio data collected throughout the journey.

- Accounts Page: Users could manage their accounts and access fleet-related information.

## Key Contributions to the Komet App
- Performance Optimization: Developed and maintained the fleet management app for Android using Kotlin, resulting in a remarkable 20% increase in app performance, stability, and responsiveness through advanced code optimizations.

- Data Pipelines: Created data pipelines to effectively process audio data collected from aircraft, ensuring seamless integration with the application.

- Model Accuracy: Optimized the neural network model to enhance accuracy up to 95%, demonstrating a keen focus on improving the application's predictive capabilities.

- Research and Reliability: Conducted in-depth research on enhancing model efficiency and preventing data drift to ensure the application remains up-to-date and reliable.

- Model Integration: Contributed to the seamless integration of the model into the application, enabling precise flight engine status predictions.

- MVVM Architecture: Implemented the MVVM architectural pattern, ensuring modular code organization and enabling the integration of complex fleet management features.

- Agile Collaboration: Collaborated with cross-functional teams in agile sprints, adhering to Scrum methodologies and utilizing tools like Jira and Git for seamless project management and version control.

- Successful Deployment: Successfully deployed the application on the Google Play Store, adhering to all platform guidelines, and providing a user-friendly and intuitive UI for pilots to interact with effortlessly.
